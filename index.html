    <p>
      Classical music is a genre of music that originated in the Western world
      during the Baroque period and is characterized by its formal structure,
      use of orchestral instruments, and adherence to traditional musical forms.
      It includes the works of great composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Mozart,
      and Tchaikovsky. Classical music is known for its complexity,
      emotionality, and ability to evoke powerful emotions in listeners. It has
      had a significant impact on modern music and continues to be a source of
      inspiration for contemporary artists.
